# Data Flow Diagrams for LASER Dashboards

This repo contains the data flow diagrams for the LASER Dashboard.

The data flow diagram images are present for each project that has the flow diagram. This repo is rendered on this website: https://lida-data-analytics-team.github.io/data_flow_diagrams/images/p0***_data_flow_diagram.png
Where `P0***` is the project number/code for each project's image. Where projects have different VRE Tiers the P-code becomes P0***_t3 or p0***_t4 and where projects have multiple diagrams the P-code for each diagram becomes P0***_a or P0***_b and so on.
